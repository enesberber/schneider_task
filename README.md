# Schneider Electrics Assignment - by Enis Aldemir

âœ” HOW TO SETUP THE ENVIRONMENT AND RUN THE TESTS? 

    > This assignment is written with Java on Selenium. 

    > It can be run with any IDE that supports Java (i.e. IntellJ, Eclipse, ...).

    > Simply clone the repository and run the project from the CukesRunner under the runners folder.

    > All dependencies and plugins are already saved under pom.xml file.

    > Values are dynamic and can be changed from the Scenario under tensorflow.feature file without deep-diving in the codes.

    > Watch assertions and error messages on the console if the tests fail. You will see brief fail reasons and places on the console.

    > You may also check the Cucumber report file (cucumber-report.html) under the target folder. This report contains test summary including screenshots if the test case fails.

    > You do not re-run whole project after maintenence. FailedTestRunner file keeps record of the failing scenarios. You may only run the failing ones by simply running the project through the FailedTestRunner.

    Enjoy :)

REQUIREMENTS

In this assignment, you should write an automation test scenario for Play ground tensor flow. TensorFlow Playground is an interactive web app that allows users to test artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with Google's TensorFlow machine learning libraries. You do not need any AI knowledge to do this task. 
  
Write an automated test case that ends up in the state of the picture: 

    i.	Go to the page: https://playground.tensorflow.org .

    ii.	Report the test loss value in console (h).

    iii.	Change dataset to exclusive as shown in (a).

    iv.	Change noise to 5 percent (b).

    v.	Select two more features (c).

    vi.	Remove one neuron (d) and (e).

    vii.	Change learning rate to 0.1 (f).

    viii.	Click to run the simulation (g).

    ix.	Wait until epoch is more than 0.3 (i).

    x.	Report the test loss value in console (h).
